            <p>  The Alumni Association of Sri Shakthi Institute of Engineering and Technology was founded in 2006 with the vision of creating a strong network of graduates who could support each other and the institute. Recognizing the importance of maintaining connections after graduation, a group of passionate faculty members and alumni came together to establish a platform that would facilitate ongoing relationships.</p>

Our founding members believed in the power of collaboration and the impact that a united alumni network could have on both personal and professional growth. Today, we continue to build on that legacy, striving to create a supportive environment for all our members.</p>
